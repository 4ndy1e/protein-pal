      <li>1 box of penne pasta (protein)</li>
      <li>1/4 cup of olive oil</li>
      <li>1 can tomato paste</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon italian seasoning</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook,
        stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11
        minutes. Drain and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Chop chicken into cubes
        and add to the skillet. Cook and stir until crumbly and brown, 5 to 7
        minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in skillet again over medium heat. Add garlic and red pepper
        flakes; cook and stir until garlic is golden brown. Add tomato paste and
        heavy cream. Bring to boil. Reduce heat and simmer for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add pasta to the tomato sauce and cheese. Reduce heat to low and stir
        until cheese is melted.
      </li>
